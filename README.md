# Decentralized Adaptive NPC (DAN)

DAN is a toolkit for game developers to integrate adaptive, AI-driven NPCs into Sonic SVM-based games. 
It combines a REST API, Sonic smart contract, and HTLC payment channels to deliver scalable NPC behavior and secure microtransactions.

## Features

- Reusable NPC templates.
- Verifiable NPC memory and state.
- AI-driven adaptive NPCs dialogue and behaviour.
- Lightling fast micropayments for in-game transactions.

## How It Works

- Anyone can create NPC templates.
- Others can create new NPC using template.
- AI generate NPC dialogue and behavior from onchain memory and state.
- In-game transactions using fast and secure payment channels.
